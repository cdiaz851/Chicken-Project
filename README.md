# Chicken-Project

This project is about using regression models and techniques to accurately predict out-of-sample data by training models using data taken from https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fphuzoman%2Fegg-producing-chickens&data=05%7C01%7Ccdiaz3%40cpp.edu%7C206a468a53bd4502566208dad30b27cf%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C638054342123075622%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3ZH%2FoPlX%2FSUsxR%2FSD3bNyBmNkuNSOuhZ3SZH6yQ3Yi8%3D&reserved=0
that was split by my professor. My team and I were able to create a decent model that predicts the weight of a chicken egg using a mix of interaction and non-interaction terms for our model. The accuracy of the model is determined by its RMSE, MAE, and R-squared values when used on an unknown test set. Our final model resulted in the following values:

RMSE    7.124517
MAE     6.07345
R^2     0.08912$,
which were close to the values given when training our model on the data given to us, which were:

$RMSE    7.014538
MAE     5.984874
R^2     0.1365871
